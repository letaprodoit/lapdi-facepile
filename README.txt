== Description ==

Let A Pro Do IT!'s (LAPDI) Facepile plugin allows you to add WordPress users photo icons to your blog's website in grid format.

= Shortcodes =

Add a `Facepile` to posts and pages by using a shortcode inside your text or evaluated from within your theme. You may override page/post `Facepile` options with shortcode attributes defined on the plugin's settings page.

* `[tsp-facepile]` - Will display a facepile with the default options defined in the plugin's settings page.
* `[tsp-facepile title="Facepile" show_names="Y" show_count="Y" num_rows="4" num_cols="4" thumb_width="80" thumb_height="80" before_title="" after_title=""]` - Will override all attributes defined on the plugin's settings page.
